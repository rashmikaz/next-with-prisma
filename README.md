# 📘 Prisma with Next.js

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## 🚀 What is Prisma?

Prisma is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that makes working with databases in JavaScript/TypeScript applications easier.

Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you define your database schema using the Prisma Schema Language (PSL), and Prisma generates a type-safe client for you to interact with your database.

✅ Benefits of Prisma:

Type-safe queries → catch errors at compile time

Auto-completion with full IntelliSense in VS Code

Supports multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, SQL Server, CockroachDB)

Easy migrations using prisma migrate

Great for Next.js (API routes, server actions, or middleware)




## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

```python

npm install @prisma/client prisma

npx prisma init

```
This will create a prisma/schema.prisma file and a .env file.
